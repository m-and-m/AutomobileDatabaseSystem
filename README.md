AutomobileDatabaseSystem
========================
I took a Database Management System class at SJSU in Fall 2012.

The course consisted of a textbook-based lecture and one project. 
In the lecture, we studied the basics of database diagnosis and design theory, 
database modeling including set theory based relational models, relation algebra and constraints,
system and user aspects of database systems, and general SQL. In the project, 
each team built an auto mobile inventory database system using static data. 

The tools and languages used were...
- Oracle Database 11g (windows)
- SQL*Plus
- Java and Swing

Unfortunately, the data is not available.
